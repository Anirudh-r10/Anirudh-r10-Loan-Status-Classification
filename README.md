# Loan Status Classification
Loan Status Classification is a machine learning project that aims to predict the approval or denial of loan applications based on various features such as income, credit score, loan amount, and more. The project employs a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and AdaBoost, to build predictive models.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and prepares the data for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights into the dataset, revealing patterns and trends that contribute to informed decision-making.
Multiple Machine Learning Models: Implements and evaluates different algorithms to compare their performance in predicting loan statuses.
Model Evaluation: Utilizes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the effectiveness of each model.
